This is a sample document for testing our RAG system.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test text extraction and chunking.

The document processor should extract this content cleanly and 
prepare it for embedding and storage in our vector database.

This helps us verify that our pipeline works correctly before 
processing real documents.
