# Test Document for RAG System

## Introduction
This is a simple test document to verify our RAG system is working correctly.

## RAG Basics
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of information retrieval with text generation. Think of it like having a smart librarian who can:

1. **Find relevant information** - Like a librarian who knows exactly which book contains the answer
2. **Understand context** - Like understanding what you're really asking for  
3. **Provide accurate answers** - Like giving you a summary with exact page references

## Benefits
- Reduces AI hallucinations by grounding responses in real documents
- Provides source citations so you can verify information
- Allows updating knowledge without retraining the entire model
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning for many use cases

## Implementation
A typical RAG system works like this:
1. Break documents into chunks (like creating index cards)
2. Convert chunks to embeddings (like creating a meaning-based filing system)
3. Store in vector database (like organizing the filing cabinet)
4. Search for relevant chunks (like finding the right index cards)
5. Generate response using found information (like writing a summary)

This document should help test the basic functionality of our RAG system.
