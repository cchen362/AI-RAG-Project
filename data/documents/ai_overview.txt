    # Artificial Intelligence Overview
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
    
    ## Key Types of AI:
    
    1. **Narrow AI**: AI designed for specific tasks (like voice assistants)
    2. **General AI**: AI with human-like cognitive abilities (still theoretical)
    3. **Super AI**: AI that exceeds human intelligence (hypothetical)
    
    ## Machine Learning
    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn without explicit programming.
    
    ### Types of Machine Learning:
    - Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data
    - Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
    - Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error
    
    ## Applications
    AI is used in healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.
