    # Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    
    RAG combines information retrieval with text generation to create more accurate AI responses.
    
    ## How RAG Works:
    
    1. **Document Processing**: Break documents into chunks
    2. **Embedding**: Convert text chunks into numerical vectors
    3. **Storage**: Store vectors in a searchable database
    4. **Retrieval**: Find relevant chunks for user queries
    5. **Generation**: Use retrieved context to generate accurate responses
    
    ## Benefits of RAG:
    - Reduces hallucinations
    - Provides source citations
    - Updates knowledge without retraining
    - Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
    
    ## RAG vs Fine-tuning:
    RAG is better for dynamic knowledge, while fine-tuning is better for style adaptation.
