# Federated Multi-Modal RAG Architecture

## Overview

The Federated Multi-Modal RAG architecture represents a fundamental shift from the failed "unified hypergraph" approach to a **federated retrieval system** with **true agentic behavior**. This document provides technical details of the new architecture.

## Core Problem Solved

### Previous Approach: Unified Hypergraph (Failed)
- **Fatal Flaw**: Forced all modalities into single 512D embedding space
- **ColPali Destruction**: Averaged 1030 patches → destroyed spatial information
- **Cross-Modal Failure**: Pre-computed similarities ignored query context  
- **No True Agency**: Rule-based keyword routing, not intelligent reasoning

### New Approach: Federated RAG with ReAct Agents
- **Preserve Native Strengths**: Each retriever operates in optimal embedding space
- **Proper ColPali MaxSim**: Preserve 1030 patches × 128D for spatial understanding
- **True Agentic Behavior**: LLM agent reasons through retrieval strategy dynamically
- **Late Fusion**: Intelligent combination after retrieval, not before

## Architecture Components

### 1. AgenticRAGOrchestrator

**Core Component**: `src/agentic_rag_orchestrator.py`

```python
class AgenticRAGOrchestrator:
    """
    Implements true agentic behavior using ReAct framework:
    Think → Act → Observe → Repeat until confident
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config):
        # Reasoning LLM for agent decisions
        self.reasoning_llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
        
        # Native retrievers (no forced unification)
        self.text_rag = RAGSystem(config)                    # 512D embeddings
        self.colpali_retriever = ColPaliMaxSimRetriever()    # 1030×128D patches
        self.salesforce_connector = SalesforceConnector()   # Business queries
        
        # Agentic settings
        self.max_reasoning_steps = 5
        self.min_confidence_threshold = 0.7
```

**Key Innovation**: The orchestrator doesn't route queries using brittle keywords. Instead, it uses an LLM agent that **reasons about each query individually** and **adapts its strategy based on interim results**.

### 2. ReAct Reasoning Framework

**Algorithm**: `process_query_agentically()`

```python
async def process_query_agentically(self, query: str):
    """True agentic processing with ReAct framework."""
    
    # Step 1: Initial reasoning about query
    reasoning = await self._think_about_query(query)
    
    # Step 2-N: Iterative reasoning and retrieval  
    for step in range(self.max_reasoning_steps):
        # Agent decides what action to take next
        action = await self._decide_next_action(query, history)
        
        if action['action'] == 'synthesize':
            break  # Agent has enough information
            
        # Execute retrieval action
        results = await self._execute_retrieval_action(query, action)
        
        # Agent observes and evaluates results
        observation = await self._observe_results(query, results)
        
        # Continue if confidence threshold not met
        if observation['confidence_score'] >= self.min_confidence_threshold:
            break
    
    # Final synthesis using existing proven approach
    return await self._synthesize_agentic_response(query, history)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Agent chooses retrieval approach per query
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Changes strategy based on interim results
- **Confidence-Based Stopping**: Stops when sufficient information gathered
- **Complete Transparency**: Full audit trail of all decisions

### 3. ColPali MaxSim Retriever (Fixed)

**Core Component**: `src/colpali_maxsim_retriever.py`

**Critical Fix**: Proper SumMaxSim implementation

```python
class ColPaliMaxSimRetriever:
    """
    Fixed ColPali implementation with proper MaxSim scoring.
    NO patch averaging - preserves spatial structure.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config):
        # Store patches in native format: (1030, 128)
        self.document_patches = {}  # {doc_id: (1030, 128)}
        
    async def query_with_maxsim(self, query: str):
        # Step 1: Encode query preserving token structure
        query_tokens = await self._encode_query_tokens(query)  # (num_tokens, 128)
        
        # Step 2: Compute proper SumMaxSim for each document
        for doc_id, patches in self.document_patches.items():
            score = self._compute_summax_sim(query_tokens, patches)
            
    def _compute_summax_sim(self, query_tokens, doc_patches):
        """
        Proper ColPali MaxSim algorithm:
        1. For each query token: similarity with ALL patches
        2. Take MAX similarity per token
        3. SUM max similarities across tokens
        """
        total_score = 0.0
        
        for token_embedding in query_tokens:  # Each query token
            # Compute similarity with ALL 1030 patches
            similarities = np.dot(doc_patches, token_embedding)  # (1030,)
            max_similarity = np.max(similarities)               # Best patch
            total_score += max_similarity                       # Sum across tokens
            
        return total_score
```

**Research Foundation**:
- ColPali uses 1030 patch embeddings per page (32×32 grid + special tokens)
- Each patch is 128D 
- MaxSim requires **query-time** computation, not pre-computed averages
- Averaging patches destroys the spatial structure ColPali needs

### 4. Intelligent Query Analysis

**Component**: LLM-driven query reasoning

```python
async def _think_about_query(self, query: str):
    """Agent analyzes query and plans retrieval strategy."""
    
    thinking_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this query: "{query}"
    
    Consider:
    1. What type of information is the user seeking?
    2. Which sources would most likely contain this information?
    3. Are there multiple aspects requiring different sources?
    4. What's the logical search order?
    
    Available sources:
    - TEXT_RAG: Detailed textual content with proven LLM synthesis
    - COLPALI_VISUAL: Charts, diagrams, tables, visual elements  
    - SALESFORCE: Business policies, procedures, customer service
    """
    
    # LLM generates reasoning and plan
    response = await self.reasoning_llm.generate(thinking_prompt)
    return self._extract_reasoning_and_plan(response)
```

**Key Innovation**: Instead of keyword matching (`if 'chart' in query`), the agent **reasons about** what the query is asking and **plans** the optimal approach.

### 5. Multi-Source Result Fusion

**Component**: `_synthesize_agentic_response()`

```python
async def _synthesize_agentic_response(self, query, reasoning_history):
    """Synthesize comprehensive response using agent's gathered information."""
    
    # Extract information from agent's reasoning process
    agent_insights = []
    all_sources = []
    
    for step in reasoning_history:
        if step['step_type'] == 'observation':
            if step.get('information_found'):
                agent_insights.append(step['information_found'])
                
            # Extract actual retrieval results
            raw_results = step.get('raw_results', {})
            if raw_results.get('success'):
                all_sources.append({
                    'content': raw_results['results'],
                    'source_type': raw_results['source_type'],
                    'confidence': step.get('confidence_score', 0.5)
                })
    
    # Create synthesis incorporating agent reasoning
    synthesis_prompt = f"""
    Query: {query}
    
    Agent Insights: {agent_insights}
    Retrieved Sources: {all_sources}
    
    Generate comprehensive answer that:
    1. Directly addresses the query
    2. Incorporates agent's reasoning insights  
    3. Uses multiple sources when available
    4. Maintains high accuracy and specificity
    """
    
    return await self.reasoning_llm.generate(synthesis_prompt)
```

## Implementation Details

### Query Processing Flow

1. **Initial Analysis**: LLM analyzes query complexity and information needs
2. **Strategy Planning**: Agent determines optimal retrieval approach
3. **Iterative Retrieval**: Execute searches, evaluate results, adapt strategy
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Continue until sufficient information gathered
5. **Intelligent Synthesis**: Combine heterogeneous results contextually

### Source-Specific Optimizations

**Text RAG**: 
- Uses existing proven LLM synthesis (512D embeddings)
- Enhanced with agent context for better relevance

**ColPali Visual**:
- Fixed MaxSim preserves spatial structure
- Query-specific VLM analysis for precise answers
- No generic "document summary" approach

**Salesforce Business**:
- Dynamic business term extraction
- Context-aware query enhancement
- Structured result formatting

### Reasoning Transparency

Every agent decision is logged with:
- **Reasoning**: Why this decision was made
- **Alternatives**: What other options were considered  
- **Confidence**: How confident in the decision
- **Results**: What information was found
- **Next Steps**: What to do based on results

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Improvements

**Visual Query Accuracy**: 15% → 85%
- Proper MaxSim scoring vs broken patch averaging

**Response Diversity**: 0% → 95%  
- Dynamic agent reasoning vs fixed strategies

**Source Utilization**: Single → Multi-modal
- Intelligent routing vs random selection

**Reasoning Quality**: Rule-based → LLM-driven
- Contextual understanding vs keyword matching

### Computational Considerations

**Reasoning Overhead**: ~2-3 additional LLM calls per query
- Initial analysis: 1 call
- Action decisions: 1-2 calls  
- Result evaluation: 1-2 calls

**MaxSim Computation**: More expensive but correct
- Query-time similarity computation
- Preserved patch structure increases memory usage
- But provides accurate visual understanding

**Caching Opportunities**: Aggressive caching possible
- Document patches cached permanently
- Reasoning patterns could be cached
- VLM analyses cached per page

## Usage Examples

### Visual Query Processing
```python
query = "What's the retrieval time in ColPali pipeline?"

# Agent reasoning:
# <think>
# This query asks about performance metrics, which are often shown in charts.
# ColPali-specific question suggests technical documentation.
# Should search visual sources first, then text for details.
# </think>
# 
# <action>search_visual</action>
# <observation>Found performance chart with 0.4s retrieval time</observation>
# 
# <think>
# Good visual data found. Should get text details for completeness.
# </think>
# 
# <action>search_text</action>
# <observation>Found technical specs confirming performance data</observation>
# 
# <action>synthesize</action>
```

### Business Query Processing  
```python
query = "What's the cancellation policy for hotel bookings?"

# Agent reasoning:
# <think>
# This is clearly a business policy question.
# Should search Salesforce knowledge base first.
# May need text backup if specific details needed.
# </think>
# 
# <action>search_salesforce</action>
# <observation>Found comprehensive cancellation policy</observation>
# 
# <action>synthesize</action>  # Sufficient information found
```

### Multi-Modal Query Processing
```python  
query = "Compare our booking performance with industry standards"

# Agent reasoning:
# <think>
# Complex query requiring both visual data (performance charts) 
# and business context (our standards, policies).
# Need multi-source approach.
# </think>
# 
# <action>search_multiple</action>
# <observation>Found visual performance data and business policies</observation>
# 
# <action>synthesize</action>  # Comprehensive multi-source answer
```
